# Wikipedia OnThisDay API Integration

This is a website which ultilises the Wikipedia OnThisDay API to pull events in categories when provided with date. 

Various additional functions on filtering the events are incorporated, including:
- Filter events according to the year provided
- Filter which category is shown
- Choose the number of events are shown

More functions are on the way when ideas strike. Feel free to leave any suggestion :)

UPDATE OCT. 3rd, 2024: NOW WITH LIGHT MODE AND CLEAN(ER) UI!
