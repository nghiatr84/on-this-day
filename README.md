This is a website which ultilises the Wikipedia OnThisDay API to pull events in categories when provided with date. Various additional functions on filtering the events are incorporated, including option to also filter events according to the year provided, filter which category is shown, and the number of events are shown. More functions are on the way when ideas strike. Feel free to leave any suggestion :)
